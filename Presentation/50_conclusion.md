## Conclusion and Future Work


**Conclusions**

\begin{enumerate}
    \item safe and efficient behaviors\\
    $\Rightarrow$ suitable approach for safety vs. efficiency tradoff
    \item near real-time planning capabilities\\
    $\Rightarrow$ already a useful high-level planner for moderately sized problems
    \item designing suitable heuristic guidance hard but crucial for performance
\end{enumerate}

**Future Work**

\begin{enumerate}
    \item theory for a-priory safety assurances
    \item improving scalability by using GPU
    \item learning for designing of heuristic guidance
\end{enumerate}
