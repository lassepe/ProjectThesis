\chapter{Summary}

\todo[inline]{Write once everything else has converged.}

% This results in robust policies for optimized interaction with uncertain
% environments. We show how this methodology provides solutions to problems where
% uncertainty otherwise, either keeps engineers from solving them in a principled
% manner or forces them to make simplifications that compromise performance and
% robustness.

\chapter{Formatting - TODO}

\begin{itemize}
  \item genitive "s" (robots vs. robot's, its vs it's) \todo{"its" is analogous to "his" or "hers"; it's is a contraction. You'll probably never use it's in technical writing.}
  \item Introduction must be page one (see TOC)
  \item (done) ix acronym capitalization
  \item maybe have acronyms rendered in italic
  \item section references in caps?
  \item look for common spelling mistakes
  \item look for "will", most things should be "present"
  \item avoid "don't", "won't", "doesn't" etc.\
  \item flows $\to$ follows
  \item make sure that there is only one version of writing "Monte-Carlo" (hyphen)
  \item policy-tree vs belief-tree
  \item maybe avoid using "That is," at the beginning of a sentence but it is not that important
\end{itemize}
